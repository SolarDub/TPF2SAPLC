ReadStarFileScript.sh HELP FILE
*******************************


To execute:

    ./ReadStarFileScript.sh [--help] [--ohelp] [-c] [-s]

Description:

    --help	Prints this help file

    --ohelp	Lists the STEREO orbits by number.
		Each new orbit starts as the center of the HI-1A field-of-view passes 0h RA.

    Both the above will quit execution on printing their respective text.


    default	With no switches, the program will read a star name and aperture size from a text file
		and apply the simple aperture photometry method to the images in the target pixel file
		resulting in the production of a photomteric time-series, i.e. lightcure, for that star.


    After entering the data relevant to the selection of the switches below,
    execution of the program will commence.


    -c		Produce a flux curve of growth.

		With this switch, the program select a target pixel image near the center of the TPF time range
		and produce a curve of growth, plotting stellar flux as a function of aperture size across
		a range of size from 0 to 5 pixels.

		Additionally, it will produce a curve of the derivative of the curve of growth, which is often
		more useful when selecting a suitable aperture with which to perfom the simple aperture photometry process.


    -s		Enter a single star name into a prompt.

		The program will use this star name and obtain its coordinates from SIMBAD.
		The star name will be passed to the main program without spaces (i.e. DXAqr from DX Aqr).

		A second prompt will follow requesting the entry of a aperture size (in pixels) with
		which to perform the Simple Aperture Photometry. A value of 3.2 is recommended, but
		any value (up to 4.5) can be entered to see the effects of varying the aperture size.
